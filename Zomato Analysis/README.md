## Data Manipulation and Reporting with Power BI

### Description

Zomato is a restaurant aggregation and meal delivery service operating globally. This project involves examining Zomato's data to accurately assess business performance. The goal is to construct an interactive Power BI report that provides insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry.

The data is available in multiple Excel files, each containing information about restaurants in a specific continent. The project aims to:

1. Derive data on the total number of restaurants worldwide, including continents, countries, and cities.
2. View global data with the ability to drill down to a granular level.
3. Extract data on restaurants with the highest average customer ratings.
4. Identify restaurants with the lowest average costs.
5. Filter and view information based on geographical dimensions, services offered, and average rating slabs.
6. Identify restaurants serving the most cuisines.
7. Design a multi-page report with easy navigation that aligns with Zomato's theme.
8. Ensure accessibility from both web browsers and mobile devices.
